## Monogame Template Solution for Jetbrains Rider

As Rider (still) does not have an official way of setting up Monogame projects, I created this template to build upon.

What's missing is Asset Pipeline support, as I don't use it. 


##### To use the template:
- Download the solution from the repository.
- Update the files (and folders) *MonogameTemplateRider.sln*, *MonogameTemplateRider/MonogameTemplateRider.csproj* and *Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs*. Replace every mention of *MonogameTemplateRider* with the desired name for your solution and project.
- Open the solution file (.sln) with Rider.
- Right click the solution in the explorer, and the refactor, and adjust namespaces to your project's name.
